# jquery-subdynamic-form
trying to figure out how to use this framework to make subdynamic forms


I forked this project from sroucheray/jquery-dynamic-form.
It looks like the guts are here to make dynamic forms containing dynamic subforms.

Can't quite figure out how to make it work yet.

Here is a link to the jQuery plugin: https://www.jqueryscript.net/form/dynamic-forms-fields.html
